<h2> The MACD strategy with Candle TRAILING Stop-Loss </h2>
<p>author@: Gert Wohlgemuth</p><br>
<p><pre>idea:
        uptrend definition:
            MACD above MACD signal
            and CCI < -50 <br>
        downtrend definition:
            MACD below MACD signal
            and CCI > 100
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<b>CCI (Commodity Channel Index). </b><br> 
CCI is calculated with the following formula:<br>

    (Typical Price - Simple Moving Average) / (0.015 x Mean Deviation)<br><br>
	
The CCI compares the current price to an average price over a period of time. <br>
The indicator fluctuates above or below zero, moving into positive or negative territory.	
</p>
<p>
Buy side CCI -parameter that determines the negative deviation at which the BUY indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (-700 .. 0)<br>
Sell side CCI -parameter that determines the positive deviation at which the SELL indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (0 .. 700)
</p>
<p>
<b>MACD (moving average convergence divergence indicator)</b>

</p>
<p>The idea is to optimize only the CCI value.<br>
    - Buy side: CCI between -700 and 0<br>
    - Sell side: CCI between 0 and 700 </p><br>

<p>SELL SIGNAL: Candle TRAILING Stop-Loss + Minimum ROI - with these values: <br>
S = 0.5 %<br>
MR = 2.5 %<br>
<pre>
ROI = "60":  1.0 %,
      "30":  3.0 %,
      "20":  4.0 %,
      "0":  5.0 % 
</pre>
User Stop loss = (0 till 32 minutes = -3.0 %, after 32 minutes = 1.0 %) </p><br>
