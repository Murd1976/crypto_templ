<h2> The 5x5 Pump Buy Signal Dev strategy </h2>
<p>
At any time, analyze last N candles<br>
- IF candles from 1 to N-X have at least R% of candles with change > 0 <br>
   -  and IF 100-(100*([N close price]/[candle 1 open price])) > P <br>
      - THEN trigger BUY 
</p><br>
<p>
NOTE:<br>
- N, X, R, P are arbitrary values entered by user <br>
- change is the difference between the candle close price and open price 
</p><br>
<p>
EXAMPLE: <br>
N=5	we instruct the bot to anaylize the last 5 candles<br>
X=0	<br>
R=100<br>
P=5
</p><br>
<p>
it is<br>
- IF 100% of the candles from 1 to 5 [N-X, or 5-0] have change > 0		[meaning: if 5 consecutive candles are GREEN candles]<br>
   - and IF 100-(100*([candle 5 close price] / [candle 1 open price])) > 5	[meaning: from candle 1 to 5, the price has increased more than 5%]<br>
      - THEN trigger BUY THEN buy
</p><br>
