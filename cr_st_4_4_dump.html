<h2> The 4x4 Dump Buy Signal Dev strategy with Candle TRAILING Stop-Loss </h2>
<p><h4>It is a -REVERSE 4x4 Pump </h4></p>
<p>At any time, analyze last N candles<br>
- IF candles from 1 to N-X have at least R% of candles with change < 0 <br>
   -  and IF 100-(100*([N close price]/[candle 1 open price])) < P <br>
  - THEN trigger BUY </p><br>

<p>NOTE: <br>
- N, X, R, P are arbitrary values entered by user<br>
  - change is the difference between the candle close price and open price </p><br>

<p>
EXAMPLE <br>
N=4	we instruct the bot to analYize the last 4 candles<br>
X=0	<br>
R=100<br>
P=-4<br>
</p>  
<p>
it is<br>
- IF 100% of the candles from 1 to 4 [N-X, or 4-0] have change < 0		[meaning: if 4 consecutive candles are RED candles]<br>
   - and IF 100-(100*([candle 4 close price]/[candle 1 open price])) < -4	[meaning: from candle 1 open price to 4 close price, the price has decreased more than 4%]<br>
      - THEN trigger BUY THEN buy</p><br>
