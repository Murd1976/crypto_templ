<h2> The Reinforced Smooth Scalp strategy with Candle TRAILING Stop-Loss </h2>
<br>
<p>
<b>ADX (Average Directional Movement Index)</b><br>
To quantify the trendâ€™s strength, the calculation of the Average Directional Index is based on a moving average of a price range expansion over a certain timeframe.<br>
the ADX values measures trend strength, and a rising ADX means that the trend is gaining strength, <br>
a falling ADX shows a trend that is losing momentum or reversing and a flat ADX shows a sideways range. 
</p>
<p>
Buy ADX -parameter that determines the low deviation at which the BUY indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (20 .. 50)<br>
Sell ADX -parameter that determines the up deviation at which the SELL indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (50 .. 100)
</p>

<p>
<b>MFI (Money Flow Index) </b><br>
Is a technical indicator that generates overbought or oversold signals using both prices and volume data.
</p>
<p>
Buy MFI -parameter that determines the low deviation at which the BUY indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (10 .. 25)<br>
Sell MFI -parameter that determines the up deviation at which the SELL indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (75 .. 100)
</p>
<p>
<b>FastK (STOCHF - Stochastic Fast)</b><br>
The fast stochastic indicator (%K) is a momentum technical indicator that aims to measure the trend in prices and identify trend reversals.
</p>
<p>
Buy FastK -parameter that determines the low deviation at which the BUY indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (10 .. 45)<br>
Sell FastK -parameter that determines the up deviation at which the SELL indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (50 .. 100)
</p>
<p>
<b>FastD (STOCHF - Stochastic Fast)</b><br>
There is also a second quantity computed known as %D, which is the 3-day SMA of the %K. It is a smoothed version of the %K. <br>
It is computed because %K is a volatile indicator and can lead to spurious signals. <br>
A smoothed version (%D) moves much slower than the %K; hence the signals generated indicate a stronger trend.
</p>
<p>
Buy FastD -parameter that determines the low deviation at which the BUY indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (10 .. 45)<br>
Sell FastD -parameter that determines the up deviation at which the SELL indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (50 .. 100)
</p>

<p>
<b>CCI (Commodity Channel Index). </b><br> 
CCI is calculated with the following formula:<br>

    (Typical Price - Simple Moving Average) / (0.015 x Mean Deviation)<br><br>
	
The CCI compares the current price to an average price over a period of time. <br>
The indicator fluctuates above or below zero, moving into positive or negative territory.	
</p>
<p>

Sell CCI -parameter that determines the positive deviation at which the SELL indicator will be generated. For this strategy available range (100 .. 200)
</p>

<p>This strategy is based around the idea of generating <br>
a lot of potentatils buys and make tiny profits on each trade<br>
we recommend to have at least 60 parallel trades at any time <br>
to cover non avoidable losses<br>
</p><br>

<p>Optimal stoploss designed for the strategy 10%<br>
This attribute will be overridden if the config file contains "stoploss"<br>
should not be below 3% loss </p><br>

<p>SELL SIGNAL: Candle TRAILING Stop-Loss + Minimum ROI - with these values: <br>
S = 0 % (means disabled signal)<br>
MR = 0 % (means disabled signal)<br>
ROI = 2.0%<br>
User Stop loss = (0 till 32 minutes = -10 %, after 32 minutes = 0 % (means disabled signal)) </p><br>
